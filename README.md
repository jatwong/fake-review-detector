# Fake Review Detector

## Project Summary
This project uses machine learning to develop a fake review detector.

Fake reviews undermine trust between buyers, sellers, and platforms, misleading buyers and damaging credibility. This was developed for an e-commerce platmore as an automated, scalable solution to filter out fake reviews. The solution aims to streamline review moderation, enhance authenticity, and improve user trust on the platform.

## Data Summary
A Kaggle dataset of 40,000 labeled reviews with attributes including product category, rating, and review text was used for this project. Preprocessing included text cleaning, encoding categorical features, calculating review length, and sentiment scoring. The data was divided into training and testing sets for model validation.

## Implementation
Following CRISP-DM and Agile, the project was structured in six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Using this iterative process allowed continuous improvement and flexibility.
